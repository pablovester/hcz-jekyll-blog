This is a layout test I had to code for the website CookUnity. I used no CSS frameworks, just plain CSS. I choose Flexbox to align my contents since it's my most favorite thing to use because it provides a native solution, instead of an external CSS framework that may cause problems to the whole page when scalating and or adding new stuff. The test was meant to be pixel perfect, with no functionality whatsover, that's why there is no JavaScript. It was a test focused more on the design of it.
Oh and it's responsive too! Try resizing the window.
